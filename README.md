# iOSAppData

This is the iOS application for the task. Just run it.

There is one problem for me about this JSON data:
  The icon_url is without any content. 
  For example: 
```
"icon_url":"https://d3m2tfu2xpiope.cloudfront.net/vehicles/walking.svg"
```
There is no content inside this url. Thereby I use my own icon images instead of icon url in my codes.

### NOTE
##### I have solve the problem of polyline. It is my mistake to miss the information in the task description. I parse the polyline in the form of googles encoded polyline algorithm format. Now it works.



The code can be optimized in the future. If there are questions, please contact with me directly.
